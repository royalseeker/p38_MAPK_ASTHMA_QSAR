Study on 2,186 compounds with reported IC50 values against MAPK p38Î± using fingerprint descriptors revealed reliable performance with R2 0.32-0.63, Q2CV 0.24-0.53, and Q2Ext 0.26-0.55. Proposed QSAR model can serve as a high-throughput tool for identifying novel inhibitors against p38 MAPKs in asthma treatment.
